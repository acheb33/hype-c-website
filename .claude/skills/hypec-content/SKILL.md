# Hype-C Content Skill

Create on-brand content for **Hype-C** — a physician-founded surface cleaner made from three ingredients: water, salt, and hypochlorous acid (HOCl).

## Brand Foundation

### What Hype-C Is
Hype-C is a surface cleaner made from water (H₂O), sodium chloride (NaCl), and hypochlorous acid (HOCl). That's it — three ingredients, full stop. HOCl is the same molecule your white blood cells produce to fight infections. It's been trusted by athletic trainers and medical professionals for years. Hype-C brings it home.

The product is a 16 fl oz trigger spray. Spray on any hard surface, wipe or let dry. No rinsing, no residue, no fumes.

**Current stage: Pre-launch.** Launching **March 2026**. The brand is building awareness. Product is not yet available for purchase. Content should build trust, educate, and grow the audience — not push sales.

**Tagline**: "Game Day Clean."
**Hero tagline**: "Safe Enough for Snack Time. Strong Enough for Game Day." — the brand's strongest line. Bridges both audiences (parents + athletes). Use as a closer on carousels, hero sections, and high-impact moments.
**Secondary taglines**: "Every Surface. Every Day."
**Company**: Hype Everything LLC, made in Houston, TX.
**Website**: hype-c.com (also at acheb33.github.io/hype-c-website)
**Email**: hello@hype-c.com
**Instagram**: @get.hypec

### Pricing (for reference only — do not lead with price in content)
DTC:
- Single bottle: $20 (+ $5.99 shipping)
- 2-Pack: $39 ($19.50/bottle, free shipping)
- 3-Pack: $54 ($18.00/bottle, free shipping)

B2B:
- 6-pack: $99
- Case of 12: $179
- Double case (24): $299

### The Founders
Four co-founders, six kids between them. Two sisters and their spouses:
- **Dr. Tam Dan Pham, MD (Tina)** — Pediatric cardiologist, mom of three. Managing Member (26%).
- **Dr. Tu Dan Nguyen, MD (Kathy)** — Sports medicine physician, mom of three. Member (26%).
- **Alex Chebaro** — Operations, product & design. Member (24%).
- **Tu Duong** — Operations, product & design. Member (24%).

**Ownership certifications**: 52% woman-owned (Tina + Kathy), 75% Asian-American owned (Tina + Kathy + Tu Duong). These are real differentiators — use them when relevant (press, B2B, institutional pitches) but don't lead with them on social unless it's a specific cultural moment or story.

The physician angle is real — two of four co-founders are board-certified physicians. This is the brand's strongest trust signal. Use it, but don't overplay it. "Physician-founded" is a fact, not a marketing gimmick. Never put words in the physicians' mouths implying medical endorsement of cleaning claims.

### Brand Positioning
- **Physician-founded**: Two board-certified physicians on the founding team. This isn't a wellness fad — it's science that parents and athletes already trust, brought home.
- **Radically simple**: Three ingredients. No fine print, no asterisks. The ingredient list IS the selling point.
- **Sports meets home**: The brand bridges athletic/fitness culture with family life. "Game Day Clean" works for a gym bag AND a highchair. The target audience lives in both worlds.
- **Confident, not preachy**: Hype-C doesn't shame other cleaners or fear-monger about chemicals. It just offers a better answer and lets the simplicity speak.
- **Pre-launch mindset**: Right now, every post builds trust and educates. No hard sells. The goal is to make people think "I want that" before they can even buy it.

### Regulatory Note
Hype-C is a surface cleaner. It is NOT registered with the EPA under FIFRA as a disinfectant, sanitizer, or pesticide. Making antimicrobial claims without EPA registration is a federal violation. There is no gray area.

**CAN say**: Cleans, freshens, removes dirt/grime/stains/odors. No harsh chemicals. Safe around kids and pets. Made with hypochlorous acid. Physician-founded. Your body naturally makes HOCl. Safe for most surfaces.

**CANNOT say — ever**: Kills/eliminates germs/bacteria/viruses/pathogens. Sanitizes. Disinfects. Anti-microbial/antimicrobial. Sterilizes. Any public health claims. Any claims implying pest/germ/pathogen control. "Kills 99.9%" or any variation, even as parody.

**Safe phrasing examples**:
- "Cleans and freshens your gear after game day"
- "No bleach, no ammonia, no harsh chemicals"
- "The clean you can trust around your family"
- "Powered by hypochlorous acid — the same molecule your immune system uses"
- "Physician-founded. Parent-approved."

## Brand Voice

**Bold and energetic meets home confidence.** The voice has two gears that blend together:

**Gear 1 — Game Day energy**: Confident, punchy, athletic. Short sentences that hit. This gear shows up in taglines, hooks, and product-forward moments. Think Nike copywriting applied to a cleaning product.

**Gear 2 — Parent confidence**: Warm, knowing, relatable. The calm assurance of a parent who's done the research and found the answer. This gear shows up in educational content, founder stories, and the "why" behind the product.

The blend is what makes Hype-C distinctive. It's not a sterile lab brand. It's not a crunchy wellness brand. It's the brand for the parent who just got home from their kid's soccer game and needs to clean the counters before dinner.

**Messaging hierarchy** (how to structure any piece of content):
1. Lead with the problem — Gear stinks. Surfaces get gross. Chemicals are sketchy.
2. Introduce the solution — HOCl, the same molecule your body makes.
3. Reinforce trust — Physician-founded. No harsh chemicals. Safe around kids and pets.
4. Call to action — Try it. One spray and you'll get it. (Soft during pre-launch.)

**Do this:**
- Lead with simplicity — "three ingredients" is always compelling
- Be direct and confident. Short sentences. Action verbs. No filler.
- Use the founder story naturally — real physicians, real families, real problem
- Make the science accessible, not academic. "Your body already makes it" is the perfect level.
- Bridge sports and home life — the audience lives in both worlds
- Use the 90s Jazz cup aesthetic in branded graphics — teal/orange splash energy
- Emphasize the physician-founded and family-owned angles
- Feature diverse, authentic family and sports content

**Don't do this:**
- Make disinfectant, sanitizer, or germ-killing claims (federal legal issue — see Regulatory Note)
- Fear-monger about other cleaners ("toxic chemicals in YOUR home!")
- Compare to Lysol, Clorox, or other disinfectant brands — directly or indirectly
- Use "kills 99.9%" or any variation, even as parody or joke
- Put words in the physicians' mouths implying medical endorsement of cleaning claims
- Use clinical/sterile imagery implying medical-grade efficacy
- Sound like a traditional household cleaning brand
- Say "chemical-free" — HOCl is a chemical. Say "no harsh chemicals" instead
- Overuse exclamation points — confidence doesn't need to shout
- Say "game-changer", "obsessed", "clean living", "non-toxic lifestyle", "mama", "mama bear"
- Position as a luxury or premium lifestyle product — this is practical and accessible

**Words we use**: Clean, simple, three ingredients, physician-founded, trusted, every surface, game day clean, no compromises, spray and go, no rinsing, no residue, no fumes

**Words we avoid**: Chemical-free, toxin-free, disinfect, sanitize, kills germs/bacteria/viruses, all-natural (legally fraught), mama/mama bear, clean living, wellness

## Visual Identity

**Design Philosophy**: Bold, clean, modern. High contrast. The visual system pulls from athletic branding (think Nike, Under Armour) blended with the simplicity of brands like Aesop or Public Goods. Dark backgrounds with bright accents. Nothing cluttered.

**Color Palette**:
- **Black**: #0A0A0A — Primary background, text on light. The dominant canvas.
- **White**: #FFFFFF — Primary text on dark backgrounds.
- **Neon Teal**: #00D2D3 — Primary brand accent for website, packaging, and print.
- **Bright Teal**: #00E5E0 — Social media logo variant (hotter for small renders). The "-C" in the logo.
- **Orange**: #FF6B35 — Secondary accent, CTAs, energy pops. Use sparingly for emphasis.
- **Purple**: #9B30FF — Tertiary accent, used in Jazz wave layers, section borders, founder cards, stat highlights. Adds depth and richness to the teal/orange system.
- **Purple Dark**: #5B1A8E — Deep purple for base layers and subtle backgrounds.
- **Light gray/off-white**: #F5F5F5 — Secondary backgrounds for lighter compositions.

Usage: Black backgrounds do the heavy lifting. Teal is the signature — used for accent and emphasis, not as a full background. Orange is the energy pop — CTAs, highlights, moments of urgency. Keep compositions high-contrast and uncluttered.

**Typography**:
- **Oswald Bold (700)** — Headlines, logo, primary display. "HYPE" in white, "-C" in Bright Teal (#00E5E0). All caps.
- **Bebas Neue Regular (400)** — Taglines, subheadings. The "GAME DAY CLEAN" energy.
- **Barlow Condensed Regular/Medium** — Body text, UI elements, longer copy.

**Logo**: "HYPE-C" with "HYPE" in white and "-C" in Bright Teal (#00E5E0), Oswald Bold, on #0A0A0A background. 1080x1080 PNG for social. Always maintain the two-tone color split. Convert text to outlines in Illustrator before export. Variants: dark with glow, dark flat (primary), light background.

**Design Aesthetic**: Inspired by the 90s Jazz cup (teal/purple splash pattern). The energy is sports, fitness, locker room, game day — not clinical or household. Think Monster Energy shelf presence, not Lysol. Matte black packaging. Bold, high-contrast, confident.

**The Jazz Wave** — Hype-C's signature visual element, used on the website hero, CTA sections, bottle label, and branded social graphics. It's a layered SVG wave system with four gradient-filled layers:
1. Deep purple base (#5B1A8E → #9B30FF, 0.5-0.2 opacity)
2. Purple/teal/orange blend (#9B30FF → #7B2D8E → #00D2D3 → #FF6B35) with glow
3. Orange sweep (#FF6B35, 0.65-0.15 opacity)
4. Neon teal front (#00FFD5 → #00D2D3, 0.7-0.2 opacity) with glow
5. Thin neon teal accent line (#00FFD5, 0.6 opacity) on top

The wave sits in the bottom portion of compositions. Use it on branded graphics, social posts, and any visual that needs to feel "Hype-C." It ties all brand touchpoints together.

**Instagram specs**: Posts should be 1080x1350px (4:5 portrait ratio) — Instagram's current standard for maximum feed real estate.

**Packaging**: Matte black HDPE bottle, 16oz trigger spray.

**Photography/Visual style**:
- High contrast, clean compositions
- Real environments: kitchen counters, highchairs, gym bags, locker rooms, car seats
- Product in context — the bottle being used, not floating in space
- Parents' and athletes' hands in frame
- Before/after energy without being gross — suggest the mess, show the clean
- Kids and sports equipment as visual anchors

## Instagram Content Creation

### Target Audiences (for content)
Two primary audiences that often overlap:

1. **Parents** — cleaning up after kids. Highchairs, toys, counters, car seats, doorknobs. They want something safe they don't have to think twice about.
2. **Sports parents** — cleaning gear after practice and games. Equipment bags, cleats, helmets, pads. They want something that works without the chemical smell in the car on the way home.

The sweet spot is the overlap: the parent who's also the sports parent. Saturday morning soccer game → afternoon at home → the same bottle handles both.

### Content Pillars

1. **The Three Ingredients** (~30% of posts)
   Education about what HOCl is and why three ingredients matter. Make the science simple and sticky. "Your body already makes it" is the core hook. Ingredient transparency as a trust-builder.

2. **Game Day / Sports Life** (~25% of posts)
   The athletic side of the brand. Training rooms, gym bags, post-practice cleanup. This pillar owns the "Game Day Clean" energy. Bold, punchy, confident.

3. **Home & Family** (~25% of posts)
   The parent side. Highchairs, kitchen counters, toys on the floor, doorknobs during cold season. Relatable, warm, knowing. The mess is real — the solution is simple.

4. **Founder & Trust** (~20% of posts)
   Physician-founded story, behind-the-scenes, "why we made this." Two physicians, six kids, one cleaner they'd actually trust. This pillar builds credibility without being self-congratulatory.

### Caption Structure

**Short & punchy** (branded graphics, product shots):
- 1-2 sentences max
- Confident, declarative
- Let the visual and the line do the work

**Medium** (education, founder story, relatable moments):
- Open with a specific, relatable moment or surprising fact
- 3-5 sentences that educate or tell a micro-story
- End with the brand truth, not a forced CTA
- During pre-launch: "Link in bio" or "Coming soon" is fine as a soft closer

### Hashtag Strategy

Use 8-12 hashtags per post. Mix these tiers:

- **Brand**: #hypec #gamedayclean #threeingredientsthatsit
- **Category**: #cleanersforsports #nontoxiccleaning #safecleaning #cleaningproducts
- **Audience**: #sportsmom #sportsdad #sportsparents #gymlife #parentlife #momlife #dadlife
- **Science/trust**: #hypochlorousacid #hocl #physicianfounded
- **Location** (when relevant): #houstonmade #madeintexas

Place hashtags after a line break at the end of the caption.

### Content Calendar Requests

When asked to create a content calendar:
- Plan in 1-week or 2-week blocks
- Aim for 3-4 posts per week
- Maintain the pillar ratio roughly
- For each post, provide: pillar, caption, visual direction, and hashtags
- Note Reel/carousel potential
- Remember: pre-launch. Build trust and awareness, not urgency to buy.

## Product Copywriting

When writing product copy for Hype-C:
- Lead with the three-ingredient simplicity — that's the hook
- "Physician-founded" is a headline-worthy trust signal
- Bridge sports and home use — one bottle, both worlds
- Never claim disinfectant/sanitizer/antimicrobial properties
- Keep the science at "your body already makes it" level — accessible, not academic
- Directions are dead simple: spray, wipe or air dry, done
- Storage note: cool, dark place, use within 6 months

---

## Website & Email Copy

- Voice matches Instagram — same confident, direct tone with slightly more room for the "why"
- Email subject lines should be direct and intriguing, not clickbaity
- Website copy rhythm: short declarative sentence, then a beat of explanation, then another punch. The current site does this well — match it.
- The ingredient disclosure / California SB 258 compliance section exists. Don't modify regulatory language without flagging it.

## Examples

### Example 1: Three Ingredients Post (Branded Graphic)

**Visual direction:** Dark background (#1a1a2e). Large white text, "H₂O + NaCl + HOCl" with the formula in teal (#00E5E0). "That's the whole label." in white below. HYPE-C logo bottom right.

**Caption:**
Three ingredients. Full stop. No fragrance to mask what's really in there. No fine print. No asterisks.

#hypec #gamedayclean #threeingredientsthatsit #nontoxiccleaning #safecleaning #hypochlorousacid #physicianfounded #cleaningproducts

### Example 2: Sports Life Post

**Visual direction:** Candid shot of a sports equipment bag unzipped on a garage floor, a hand reaching for the Hype-C bottle nearby. Natural light, slightly gritty, real.

**Caption:**
The bag comes home. The smell doesn't have to. One spray, no fumes, no rinsing. Just clean.

#hypec #gamedayclean #sportsmom #sportsdad #sportsparents #gymlife #nontoxiccleaning #cleanersforsports

### Example 3: Home & Family Post

**Visual direction:** A highchair after a meal — cheerios on the tray, sauce smears, the beautiful chaos. Hype-C bottle in the parent's hand, mid-spray. Warm kitchen light.

**Caption:**
Lunch ended ten minutes ago. The evidence will be gone in ten seconds. No rinsing. No residue. No worrying about what's left behind on the tray.

#hypec #gamedayclean #parentlife #nontoxiccleaning #safecleaning #highchairchaos #cleaningproducts #physicianfounded

### Example 4: Founder Trust Post

**Visual direction:** Casual photo of the founding team or one of the physicians at home with their kids. Not staged — real kitchen, real life.

**Caption:**
Two of our four co-founders are board-certified physicians. Six kids between us. We didn't start Hype-C because the market needed another cleaner. We started it because we couldn't find one we fully trusted around our own families. So we made it. Three ingredients. That's it.
